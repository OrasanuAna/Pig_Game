# Pig Game ðŸŽ²

A fun and interactive dice game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! Test your luck and enjoy a friendly competition.

## Description

Pig Game is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The first player to reach a set score wins the game. However, beware: rolling a 1 will reset your turn score to zero, and itâ€™ll be the other playerâ€™s turn!

## How to Play

1. Each player takes turns rolling the dice.
2. During a turn, the player can roll to add to their current score or hold to add their current score to their total.
3. If a player rolls a 1, their current turn ends, and they lose any points accumulated during that turn.
4. The first player to reach the target score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.

## Features

- Dynamic score tracking
- Reset option to start a new game
